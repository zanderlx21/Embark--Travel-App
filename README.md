# Embark--Travel-App

This was my final project for Grand Circus Bootcamp.

My partner and I were tasked to create an app, using React, that displayed info off an API while also allowing the user to perform CRUD operations. 
We both loved travel so we used the Yelp API to generate info on hotels, restaurants, and various activities then created an itinerary list 
to help the user keep track of their favorite activities, when planning out their next trip!
